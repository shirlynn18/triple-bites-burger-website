# 🍔 Triple Bites Burger Website

**Triple Bites** is a dynamic and interactive burger restaurant website designed for fast food enthusiasts. It simulates an engaging and user-friendly online ordering experience tailored to modern consumer behavior and expectations.

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a modern fast food ordering system centered on burgers — a universally loved meal. Inspired by market insights, it replicates a real-world online burger store, highlighting the full user journey: from signup and browsing to customization and checkout.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a front-end burger ordering website that emphasizes:
- Simulated online ordering experience
- Appealing and intuitive interface
- Realistic customer journey (Login → Browse → Customize → Order)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & Grid Layout)
- **JavaScript** (DOM, localStorage)

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔐 **Signup/Login Modals** – with form validation and localStorage-based session simulation  
- 🏠 **Home Page** – welcoming brand introduction and quick access to sections  
- 📋 **Menu & Product Info Pages** – dynamic loading, customization (add-ons/removals), quantity control  
- 🛒 **Cart System** – editable cart, total price calculation, and order confirmation

- 🧑‍💼 **Account Page** – user info editing and persistent data updates  
- 📞 **Contact Us Page** – feedback form for customer inquiries  

## 🎨 Design & Branding

The visual theme uses **brown** and **yellow** for psychological and brand impact:
- 🟡 **Yellow**: evokes energy, happiness, and stimulates appetite (e.g., cheese, buns)

These color choices align with fast-food marketing trends and help reinforce brand identity.
